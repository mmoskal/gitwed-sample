# Sample website data for GitWEd

Follow instructions in [GitWEd repo](https://github.com/mmoskal/gitwed/blob/master/README.md#running-locally).

In short, run `npm install` and then `npm start` here. Go to http://localhost:3000.
Edit files at will. You can also use the online editor - it will not commit or push
automatically.
